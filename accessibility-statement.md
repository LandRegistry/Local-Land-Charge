        <h2 class='heading-large' id='sectionfour'>Enforcement procedure</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en">The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)</a> is responsible for enforcing the accessibility regulations.</p>
        <p>If you are not happy with how we respond to your complaint <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.</p>
        <h2 class='heading-large' id='sectionfive'>Technical information about this website's accessibility</h2>
        <p>HM Land Registry commit to making its website accessible, in accordance with <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/852/contents/made">the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="heading-medium">Compliance status</h3>
        <p>This website is partially compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the following non-compliances.</p>
        <h2 class='heading-large' id='sectionsix'>Non-accessible content</h2>
        <p>The following content is not accessible. We have provided an explanation and reference to the relevant WCAG section.</p>
        <h3 class='heading-small'>PDF files</h3>
        <div class='grey-background'>
            <p>Currently some of the PDF files found in the Migration Hub are not fully PDF or UA compliant. Some of these PDF files do not meet the basic requirements criteria due to font not being embedded. There have also been issues reported with tagged content and artifacts.</p>
            <p>There are also some issues with the logical structure of some PDF files such as structure elements missing bounding boxes and alternative descriptions.</p>
            <p>Some PDF files have been flagged to have missing PDF or UA identifiers which is classed as a Metadata and Settings issue. All these issues may affect the order in which the screen reader reads text from the PDF files affected, it may not always be in the logical order.</p>
            <p>These PDF files are supplied to us by people external to the service, therefore we are not able to anticipate whether the PDF files are PDF or UA compliant when we receive them and upload them to the migration hub.</p>
