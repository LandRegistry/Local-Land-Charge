This website is run by HM Land Registry.  We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website.  For example, that means you should be able to:

<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
    <li>zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
    <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
</ul>

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

<a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

<h2 class="heading-large">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>

HM Land Registry is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

<h2 class="heading-large">Non-accessible content</h2>

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

<h2 class="heading-large">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>

Currently some of the PDF files found in the Migration Hub are not fully PDF/UA compliant. Some of these PDF files do not meet the basic requirements criteria due to font not being embedded. There have also been issues reported with tagged content and artifacts.

There are also some issues with the logical structure of some PDF files such as structure elements missing bounding boxes and alternative descriptions.

Some PDF files have been flagged to have missing PDF/UA identifiers which is classed as a Metadata and Settings issue. All of these issues may affect the order in which the screen reader reads text from the PDF files affected, it may not always be in the logical order.

These PDF files are supplied to us by people external to the service, therefore we are not able to anticipate whether the PDF files are PDF/UA compliant when we receive them and upload them to the migration hub.

<h2 class="heading-large">Disproportionate burden</h2>

There are no features in this service that are considered to be a disproportionate burden.

<h2 class="heading-large">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h2>

We are also aware that some pages on the system have links to gov.uk sites external to the service that aren’t very accessible. This does fall outside of the scope of accessibility regulations for this service in particular as we are not responsible for those sites external to the service.

<h2 class="heading-large">How we tested this website</h2>

We conducted internal testing against the W3C WAI <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> and logged all test steps, results and defects in the quality management software ‘Quality Center’.

We have tested the service via the use of:
<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>WAVE evaluation tools (for contrast detection, heading, legend and label checks)</li>
    <li>W3C Markup Validation Service (for HTML validation)</li>
    <li>Web Developer Tools (for disabling of JavaScript, as well as checking table layout, links, fieldsets and images with alt text)</li>
    <li>Dragonspeak and JAWS screen readers</li>
    <li>PAC3 automated tool, for assessing PDF accessibility compliance</li>
</ul>

We tested:
<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>Our Migration Hub platform, available via the link <a href="https://landregistry.github.io/local-land-charges/">https://landregistry.github.io/local-land-charges/</a></li>
    <li>The PDF files that can be found within the Migration Hub platform</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="heading-large">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>

We are aware of issues on the site, as listed in the section ‘non-compliance with accessibility regulations’ and are documenting these issues in order to schedule time for fixes into our development work cycle.
