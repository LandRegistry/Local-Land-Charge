        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Purpose</h4>
          <p>An overview of the things a local authority needs to consider when preparing for HM Land Registry or their Delivery Partners to scan their non-digital data. This includes identifying what needs to be scanned and the location and volume of the non-digital data.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Best practice</h4>
          <p>Scanning is usually undertaken by HM Land Registry or their Delivery Partners and is generally completed off-site.</p>
          <p>The non-digital data will be collected from the local authority and returned in the same format once the scanning has been completed. Only non-digital data that is required for migrating onto the HM Land Registry digital register will be included in the scanning exercise.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>A plan can be put in place for the removal of non-digital records.</p>
          <p>Scanning activity undertaken by HM Land Registry or their Delivery Partners will be in the correct format and to the required quality for inclusion on the HM Land Registry digital register</p>
          <p class='inset-text'>It is possible for local authorities to scan their non-digital data, rather than sending it to HM Land Registry to be scanned. However, it is recommended that a small data sample is checked by HM Land Registry for accuracy and quality at the start of the process.</p>

        </div>
        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Purpose</h4>
          <p>An overview of the things a local authority needs to consider when preparing to self-extract electronic and digital data. This includes preparation before the extract, activities during extraction and sharing the extracted data with HM Land Registry when it is available.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Best practice</h4>
          <p>Ensure you are confident using the extraction tool installed by your incumbent supplier and you are using the latest version.</p>
          <p>Remember to reset the data every time you begin a new extract and inform your Delivery Manager of the date you will be sending the extracted data to HM Land Registry so they can make the necessary preparations to receive it.</p>
          <p>If you are unsure of any stages in the process, HM Land Registry has Technical Delivery Managers who can work with local authorities to help you get this right.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>Local authority has control over extracting data and can fit it within its own timelines.</p>
          <p>Extracted data will be run through a Data Analysis Dashboard to identify data improvement work that needs to be undertaken.</p>
          <p>Ability to extract data at regular intervals throughout the migration journey to show progress made in data improvement work.</p>
          <p class='inset-text'>Data extracts can be taken at any time without interrupting normal business operations. However, local authorities have the option to run them overnight or at the weekend. The time taken to extract the data is mainly dependent on the size of the dataset.</p>

        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Purpose</h4>
          <p>The Data Analysis Dashboard (dashboard) is a tool used by HM Land Registry to help local authorities get a better understanding of the current condition of their digital data. The output report from the tool will inform the local authority of the volume and type of data improvement work that is needed to ensure it is ready for migration onto the digital register.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Best practice</h4>
          <p>The earlier a data extract can be provided to HM Land Registry so it can be run through the dashboard the better.</p>
          <p>The dashboard report provides comprehensive insight into the size of the task facing the local authority and will also highlight areas where HM Land Registry may be able to help by completing the data improvement work for them.</p>
          <p>Several dashboards can be run during migration to track the progress of the data improvement work.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>Early understanding of the type and volume of data improvement work that will need to be completed.</p>
          <p>Ability to plan resources to carry out the required data improvement work.</p>
          <p>Opportunity to have a regularly updated view of the condition of the digital data to show progress made.</p>

        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Purpose</h4>
          <p>Gain a holistic view of the current processes and data sources used when responding to an LLC1 search request. Understanding which IT systems are used, the quality of the data, the volumes of non-digital data and where it is stored,  helps to inform the development of the delivery plan. The delivery plan is a timeline of activities that need to be carried out for a successful migration.</p>
         <h4 class='heading-small'>Best practice</h4>
          <p>A workshop is usually held to determine:</p>
          <ol class='list list-bullet list-indented'>
            <li>how to respond to an LLC1 search request</li>
            <li>how to manually create a charge</li>
            <li>semi-automatic creation of charge</li>
            <li>updating and cancelling charges</li>
            <li>charge inventory – current register parts and charge types</li>
            <li>IT systems – a look at key systems and any planned upgrades</li>
            <li>data quality – the presence of duplicates or PAI issues</li>
            <li>data completeness – missing spatial</li>
            <li>data sources – digital, electronic, paper</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The attendees at the workshop should be anyone who is involved in processing an LLC1 search request or can add value to the discussion of the topics listed above.</p>
          <p>Once all the relevant information has been determined, the Delivery Manager, along with the local authority, will create a delivery plan.</p>
          <p>This is a living document and should be reviewed and updated regularly.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>Changes to current processes are identified early so training can be provided.</p>
          <p>All relevant data sources are identified and the requirement for scanning or digitisation of non-digital records can be included in the delivery plan.</p>
          <p>The quality and completeness of the data identified during discovery will help inform the development of the delivery plan. This helps local authorities plan their resources to meet the delivery timeline.</p>
          <p class='inset-text'>The delivery timeline is determined by several factors, such as the size of the dataset, the type of data (digital, non-digital or a mixture of both) and the resources available to prepare the data. There is no fixed duration for the process of migrating a local authority's data.</p>

        </div>
        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Purpose</h4>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>ARTs</h4>
          <p><span class='bold'>Analysis</span> is an ongoing process during migration delivery and builds on the initial analysis, which started with Early Engagement. This is often driven by data extracts in the first instance and will include ‘dashboards’ and regular collaboration.</p>
          <p><span class='bold'>Rules</span> in this context refers to business rules which our analysts can apply to the data to effect change on a large scale, rather than manually changing each charge individually.</p>
          <p><span class='bold'>Transformation</span> refers to the ongoing changes to the data, informed by the analysis and completed by HM Land Registry and local authority colleagues in collaboration.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Best practice</h4>
          <p>Analysis starts after the first data extract and continues throughout the migration journey.</p>
          <p>Once it has been established that the implementation of business rules will benefit the local authority, the business analyst will work with them to determine which business rules are most applicable:</p>
          <ol class='list list-bullet list-indented two-joining-lists'>
            <li>global rules which are applicable to all local authorities</li>
          </ol>
          <span class='bold or-padding'>or</span>
          <ol class='list list-bullet list-indented'>
            <li>local rules which are tailored to meet the specific needs of the individual local authority.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Business rules will be agreed upon with a local authority prior to being applied to their data.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>Regular analysis monitors the progress of the data corrections and identifies areas of improvement.</p>
          <p>Business rules negate the need for a local authority to undertake manual corrections to the data.</p>
          <p>Saves time as data corrections are automated – this includes adding missing data and applying corrections to a large number of charges.</p>

          <h3><span class='heading-content'>Formative Assessment</span></h3>
        </div>
        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Purpose</h4>
          <p>To verify the accuracy and completeness of the charges, our Quality Assurance team will complete a series of checks. These tests will be conducted towards the end of the analysis, rules, and transformation (ART) time.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Best practice</h4>
          <p>The Delivery Manager will aim to schedule this to fall after the majority of data transformation work has been completed.</p>
          <p>They will also allow appropriate time in the plan to respond to the outcomes, which might include further checking to prove/disprove trends.</p>
          <p>It is common for there to be fixes/amendments to be identified through this process.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>Checking early helps spot errors and gives plenty of time for fixes to be implemented before Final Quality Assurance near the end of the Migration Delivery journey.</p>
          <p>The quality and accuracy are more likely to be at the required standard and progression to the Live Service is quicker and easier.</p>

          <h3><span class='heading-content'>The final quality assurance and search comparison</span></h3>
        </div>
        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Purpose</h4>
          <p><span class='bold'>Final Quality Assurance</span>shares similarities in practice with the earlier Formative Assessment process. It involves a combination of automated logic checks and human manual sampling.</p> 
          <p>The goal is to ensure that the charges meet the required standard of accuracy and quality to be included in the new HM Land Registry Register.</p>
          <p><span class='bold'>Search Comparison</span><p> process involves comparing real, historical search results generated by the local authority with results obtained from the transformed data in our Live Service staging environment, for the same address search. This comparison aims to identify any discrepancies in the results.</p>
          <p>Results will either show omissions (a charge not revealed by the new register, which was revealed by the local authority). Commissions (charges revealed by the transformed register but not previously revealed by the local authority). Or each search will match in terms of charges revealed.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Best practice</h4>
          <p>Final Quality Assurance might show some accuracy issues – these will need to be corrected. Further checking may need to be undertaken to ensure that errors aren’t part of a wider trend.</p>
          <p>The search comparison exercise is often completed in stages and involves regular feedback sessions with the local authority team. Commissions are not uncommon due to the spatial nature of the transformed register.</p>
          <p>Omissions need to be explained and rectified if deemed to be an error.</p>
          <p>The Delivery Manager will allow time in the plan for analysis and remedial work which the local authoruty may need to undertake.</p>
          <p>The overall approach continues to be collaborative.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>Broad and thorough checking ensures the data being migrated is accurate.</p>
          <p>Post-migrated issues are minimised, and customers receive excellent service.It is important to highlight that these checks are conducted independently of the Migration Delivery team, ensuring they are impartial and objective in nature.</p>
          <p class='inset-text'>By performing quality checks early with the Formative Assessment, the local authority can identify and correct errors while still in the data cleansing phase. This approach ensures the data is in a good, clean state when it reaches the Final Quality Assurance, requiring little management at the end of the migration journey.</p>

        </div>
        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
         <h4 class='heading-small'>Purpose</h4>
          <p>The Migration Helper is a web-based tool, which is used by <span class='bold'>both</span> the local authority and the HM Land Registry Data Transformation teams to create or amend spatial extent data.</p>
          <p>It uses the data associated with a charge to suggest several ‘candidate’ polygons for charges without spatial extents.</p>
          <p>This plotting often removes the need to plot a spatial extent from scratch, and can also be used to amend textual data.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Best practice</h4>
          <p>Determining the most effective utilisation of the tool is a collaborative decision. We will conduct tool demonstrations and offer training as needed.We will demo the tool and provide training as required.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>HM Land Registry has the ability to efficiently handle large volumes of potentially simpler tasks, including creating tens of thousands of spatial extents for individual migrations.The tool is sometimes easier to use for LAs than the in-house incumbent systems.</p>
          <p>The use of the tool together with the Data Transformation team can free up time for local authority officers to focus on the more complex charge decisions where, local knowledge is important.</p>
          <p>Progress is fed back regularly via the Delivery Manager and Data Manager.</p>

          <p>Our Migration Helper tool can be used to address these issues and we can help correct some of these issues for the LA.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Best practice</h4>
          <p>HM Land Registry will work collaboratively with the local authority to determine the best approach.</p>
          <p>Where possible HMLR will use automation within the Migration Helper tool to resolve the bulk of positional accuracy issues en-masse. This helps to create time for the local authority to fix the more complex issues.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>Our standardised approach has been derived from our experience in handling migrations for other local authorities.Automation, where possible, helps release time for experienced officers to focus on the more complex requirements.</p>
          <p class='inset-text'>Potential positional accuracy problems are first identified during the Early Engagement phase. A further examination is conducted during data discovery activities, as the local authority progresses along its migration journey.

        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Purpose</h4>
          <p>The ‘extent of change’ is about understanding what the future register will look like, how it will function and how this will impact your current operation. It’s the ‘as is’ compared to the ‘to be’.</p>
          <p>There are two overarching key principles to the final product:</p>
          <ol class='list list-bullet list-indented'>
            <li>charges will all have a spatial extent - it will be a spatial register</li>
            <li>search results will be automatic – no human checks or fine-tuning before results are provided to the customer</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This is a good time to consider how you would prefer the future service to work. Is it feasible to use an API, so changes update automatically from your incumbent system to the HMLR LLC Register? Alternatively, you can input changes directly into the LLC Register via a web-based user interface. This option often doubles the workload, as the same charge changes are also input into your incumbent system.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Best practice</h4>
          <ol class='list list-bullet list-indented'>
            <li>Identify and potentially document current processes</li>
            <li>Engage with other departments and/or teams which contribute to your LLC register, for example the planning team. Ensure they are aware of the extent of change</li>
            <li>Engage with incumbent software suppliers to gauge options,for instance do they have an API?</li>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>The benefit of understanding the transformational work from an early stage ensures you can start to make the required changes much sooner.</p>
          <p>Transformational work can be spread over a longer period, reducing the day-to-day impact on resources. For example, you can introduce plotting spatial extents when generating new charges if you are not already doing so. This change might involve linking with ‘feeder’ departments. If change is required, longer lead times generally help make the transition easier.</p>
          <p class='inset-text'>If there are changes to processes, the Delivery Manager will help to identify the necessary training. With HM Land Registry’s support, local authorities can manage minor changes in-house. HM Land Registry will provide training for major changes, such as the adoption of the User Interface (UI).</p>
          <p>It is helpful if a local authority makes a prompt decision about using the Application Programming Interface (API) or the UI, so the appropriate interfaces can be set up, and training provided.</p>
