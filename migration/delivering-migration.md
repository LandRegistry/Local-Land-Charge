          <h3 class='heading-medium'>Scan your data</h3>
        </div>
        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <p>Scanning is usually undertaken by HM Land Registry or their Delivery Partners and is generally completed off-site.</p>
          <p>The non-digital data will be collected from the local authority and returned in the same format once the scanning has been completed. Only non-digital data that is required for migrating onto the HM Land Registry digital register will be included in the scanning exercise.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>A plan can be put in place for the removal of non-digital records.</p>
          <p>Scanning activity undertaken by HM Land Registry or their Delivery Partners will be in the correct format and to the required quality for inclusion on the HM Land Registry digital register</p>
          <p class='inset-text'>It is possible for local authorities to scan their non-digital data, rather than sending it to HM Land Registry to be scanned. However, it is recommended that a small data sample is checked by HM Land Registry for accuracy and quality at the start of the process.</p>

          <h3 class='heading-medium'>Extract your data</h3>
        </div>
        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <p>Ensure you are confident using the extraction tool installed by your incumbent supplier and you are using the latest version.</p>
          <p>Remember to reset the data every time you begin a new extract and inform your Delivery Manager of the date you will be sending the extracted data to HM Land Registry so they can make the necessary preparations to receive it.</p>
          <p>If you are unsure of any stages in the process, HM Land Registry has Technical Delivery Managers who can work with local authorities to help you get this right.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>Local authority has control over extracting data and can fit it within its own timelines.</p>
          <p>Extracted data will be run through a Data Analysis Dashboard to identify data improvement work that needs to be undertaken.</p>
          <p>Ability to extract data at regular intervals throughout the migration journey to show progress made in data improvement work.</p>
          <p class='inset-text'>Data extracts can be taken at any time without interrupting normal business operations. However, local authorities have the option to run them overnight or at the weekend. The time taken to extract the data is mainly dependent on the size of the dataset.</p>

        </div>
        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <p>The earlier a data extract can be provided to HM Land Registry so it can be run through the DAD the better.</p>
          <p>This will provide a comprehensive insight into the size of the task facing the local authority and will also highlight areas where HM Land Registry may be able to help by completing the data improvement work for them.</p>
          <p>Several data analysis can be run over the duration of the migration journey to keep track of progress made with the data improvement work.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>Early understanding of the type and volume of data improvement work that will need to be completed.</p>
          <p>Ability to plan resources to carry out the required data improvement work.</p>
          <p>Opportunity to have a regularly updated view of the condition of the digital data to show progress made.</p>

          <h3 class='heading-medium'>Start a discovery</h3>
        </div>
        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <p>A workshop is usually held to determine:</p>
          <ol class='list list-bullet list-indented'>
            <li>how to respond to an LLC1 search request</li>
            <li>how to manually create a charge</li>
            <li>semi-automatic creation of charge</li>
            <li>updating and cancelling charges</li>
            <li>charge inventory – current register parts and charge types</li>
            <li>IT systems – a look at key systems and any planned upgrades</li>
            <li>data quality – the presence of duplicates or PAI issues</li>
            <li>data completeness – missing spatial</li>
            <li>data sources – digital, electronic, paper</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The attendees at the workshop should be anyone who is involved in processing an LLC1 search request or can add value to the discussion of the topics listed above.</p>
          <p>Once all the relevant information has been determined, the Delivery Manager, along with the local authority, will create a delivery plan.</p>
          <p>This is a living document and should be reviewed and updated regularly.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>Changes to current processes are identified early so training can be provided.</p>
          <p>The quality and completeness of the data identified during discovery will help inform the development of the delivery plan. This helps local authorities plan their resources to meet the delivery timeline.</p>
          <p class='inset-text'>The delivery timeline is determined by several factors, such as the size of the dataset, the type of data (digital, non-digital or a mixture of both) and the resources available to prepare the data. There is no fixed duration for the process of migrating a local authority's data.</p>

          <h3 class='heading-medium'>Do an analysis</h3>
        </div>
        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <p>The analysis starts after the first data extract and continues throughout the migration journey.</p>
          <p>Once it has been established that the implementation of business rules will benefit the local authority, the business analyst will work with them to determine which business rules are most applicable:</p>
          <ol class='list list-bullet list-indented two-joining-lists'>
            <li>global rules which are applicable to all local authorities</li>
          </ol>
          <span class='bold or-padding'>or</span>
          <ol class='list list-bullet list-indented'>
            <li>local rules which are tailored to meet the specific needs of the individual local authority.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Business rules will be agreed upon with a local authority prior to being applied to their data.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>Regular analysis monitors the progress of the data corrections and identifies areas of improvement.</p>
          <p>Business rules negate the need for a local authority to undertake manual corrections to the data.</p>
          <p>Saves time as data corrections are automated – this includes adding missing data and applying corrections to a large number of charges.</p>

          <h3 class='heading-medium'>Complete a formative assessment</h3>
        </div>
        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <p>The Delivery Manager will endeavour to schedule this to fall after the majority of data transformation work has been completed.</p>
          <p>They will also allow appropriate time in the plan to respond to the outcomes, which might include further checking to prove/disprove trends.</p>
          <p>It is common for there to be fixes/amendments to be identified through this process.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>Checking early helps spot errors and gives plenty of time for fixes to be implemented before Final Quality Assurance near the end of the Migration Delivery journey.</p>
          <p>The quality and accuracy are more likely to be at the required standard and progression to the Live Service is quicker and easier.</p>

        </div>
        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <p>Final Quality Assurance might show some accuracy issues – these will need to be corrected. Further checking may need to be undertaken to ensure that errors aren’t part of a wider trend.</p>
          <p>The Search Comparison exercise is often completed in stages and involves regular feedback sessions with the LA team. Commissions are not uncommon due to the spatial nature of the new register.</p>
          <p>Omissions need to be explained and rectified if deemed to be an error.Omissions need to be explained and rectified if deemed to be an error.</p>
          <p>The Delivery Manager will allow time in the plan for analysis and remedial work which the LA may need to undertake.</p>
          <p>The overall approach continues to be collaborative.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>Broad and thorough checking ensures the data being migrated is accurate.</p>
          <p>Post-migrated issues are minimised, and customers receive excellent service.</p>
          <p class='inset-text'>By performing quality checks early with the Formative Assessment, the local authority can identify and correct errors while still in the data cleansing phase. This approach ensures the data is in a good, clean state when it reaches the Final Quality Assurance, requiring little management at the end of the migration journey.</p>

          <h3 class='heading-medium'>Start using the Migration Helper tool</h3>
        </div>
        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <p>The Migration Helper is a web-based tool, which is used by <span class='bold'>both</span> the local authority and the HMLR Data Transformation Teams.</p>
          <p>It is used to create or amend spatial extent data and can also be used to amend textual data.</p>
          <p>It uses the data associated with a charge to suggest several ‘candidate’ polygons for charges without spatial extents, which often removes the need to plot a spatial extent from scratch.</p>
          <p>We will demo the tool and provide training as required.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>The tool is sometimes easier to use for LAs than the in-house incumbent systems.</p>
          <p>The use of the tool together with the Data Transformation Team can free up time for Local Authority officers to focus on the more complex charge decisions where, perhaps, local knowledge is key.</p>
          <p>Progress is fed back regularly via the Delivery Manager and Data Manager.</p>

          <h3 class='heading-medium'>Identify any Positional Accuracy Issues (PAI)</h3>
        </div>
        <div class='step-by-step-content'>
          <p>Our Migration Helper tool can be used to address these issues and we can help correct some of these issues for the LA.</p>
          <p>HM Land Registry will work collaboratively with the Local Authority to determine the best approach.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>Automation, where possible, helps release time for experienced officers to focus on the more complex requirements.</p>
          <p class='inset-text'>Potential positional accuracy problems are first identified during the Early Engagement phase. A further examination is conducted during data discovery activities, as the local authority progresses along its migration journey. A PAI dashboard is only run when it is deemed necessary to verify an issue.</p>

          <p>There are two overarching key principles to the final product:</p>
          <ol class='list list-bullet list-indented'>
            <li>charges will all have a spatial extent. It will be a spatial register</li>
            <li>search results will be automatic – no human checks or fine-tuning before results are provided to the customer</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Therefore, in simple terms, the extent of change is how far away from this you currently are.</p>
          <p>This is also a good time to consider how you’d prefer the future service to work.</p>
          <h4 class='heading-small'>Benefits</h4>
          <p>Understanding the transformational work upfront means that you can start to make the changes required much sooner and spread the work over a longer period, reducing the day-to-day impact on resources.</p>
          <p class='inset-text'>If there are changes to processes, the Delivery Manager will help to identify the necessary training. With HM Land Registry’s support, local authorities can manage minor changes in-house. HM Land Registry will provide training for major changes, such as the adoption of the User Interface (UI).</p>
          <p>It is helpful if a local authority makes a prompt decision about using the Application Programming Interface (API) or the UI, so the appropriate interfaces can be set up, and training provided.</p>
