    <p>Information on the terms between HM Land Registry (HMLR) and local authorities (LAs).</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class='heading-small'>What is it</h2>
    <p>Terms of Collaboration (ToC) is an agreement between HM Land Registry (HMLR) and a local authority (LA). It authorises HMLR to receive data from the LA and begin data assessment activities.</p>
    <p>Under the agreement, the LA makes its Local Land Charge (LLC) data available to HMLR. This includes both the textual and spatial elements to:</p>
    <ol class='list list-bullet list-indent'>
      <li>analyse where authority data is not suitable for migration</li>
      <li>identify areas needing work before to migration</li>
      <li>identify areas of data enhancement during migration by applying HLMR business rules</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2 class='heading-small'>When it is signed</h2>
    <p>We issue the ToC during early engagement with the LA. They must complete it before sharing the data with HMLR.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class='heading-small'>What happens next</h2>
    <p>The LA’s complete dataset of LLC records goes to HMLR to go through the Data Analysis Dashboard (DAD). This includes both the textual and spatial elements</p>
    <p>The ToC is valid for 12 months (with option to extend).</p>
    <p>The DAD allows early insight into the LA’s data and improvement work. This needs to meet the required standard for inclusion on the digital register.</p>
    <p>On completion, the LA can progress through Early Engagement and into service migration.</p>
