          <span class='bold'>Scanning and digitisation of non-digital data</span>
          <p>Our dedicated scanning team can work with you to provide resource to scan your paper, microfiche and other non- digital records. Where your records are taken offsite, we have a 24-hour service level agreement to get any pertinent information required for a search back to you.</p>
          <span class='bold'>Business Analyst Support</span>
          <p>Our business analysts will work with you to create process maps and identify your data sources. They’ll also be able to support you with business rules and bulk fixes agreed with you, to limit your staff having to make individual changes/fixes where possible.</p>
          <span class='bold'>Dedicated Delivery Managers</span>
          <p>Each authority is assigned a Delivery Manager who can provide access to HMLR subject matter experts and will be a first port of call for any queries. The Delivery Manager will liaise with external suppliers as well as local authority IT department to ensure a smooth migration.</p>

          <span class='bold'>Removing non-digital data from your authority</span>
          <p>Scanning your non-digital data prepares your local authority for migration. It does not detract or remove work from suppliers once they are on board if they are undertaking scanning services. Digitising your data allows you to understand what work is left to be done before you make the decision to enter service migration.</p>

          <span class='bold'>Data Analysis Dashboard</span>
          <p>This tool is designed to quantify what we know about your dataset. By analysing your data multiple times as you progress through your migration, we’ll be able to identify what fixes can be applied and which areas need to be worked on.</p>
          <span class='bold'>Migration Helper</span>
          <p>This tool identifies gaps in spatial datasets. Working with your staff, our programme team will use the Migration Helper to create spatial extents from your existing records to ensure your dataset is complete.</p>

          <span class='bold'>Burdens payment</span>
          <p>Local authorities will receive a burdens payment within 3 months of migration that covers the cost of:</p>
          <ol class='list list-bullet'>
            <li>extraction of data from current digital systems</li>
            <li>data preparation</li>
            <li>provision of information to create spatial extents</li>
            <li>providing updates to the register during migration</li>
            <li>resolution of enquiries arising during the migration process</li>
            <li>payment for the one-off activities and first 3 years of additional work to add, vary and cancel charges will be made at the same time</li>
          </ol>
          <p>HM Land Registry is paying existing local authority software suppliers for work to automate the process for updating through application programming interfaces (API) local authority systems. We will pay suppliers API maintenance for 3 years.</p>
          <p>If a local authority undertakes development of their own API integration instead of using one provided by a supplier, work done will form part of the burdens payments made within 3 months of migration.</p>
          <span class='bold'>Transition payments</span>
          <p>The transition payment will be in addition to the new burdens. It covers any costs a local authority may incur when migrating their data. This means the overall financial support available will be more than £40m. The payment can be used by LAs for resources, such as administrative support, equipment or services that will enable a smooth and timely migration.</p>
          <p>Payments will be based on the size of the housing market the local authority provides service for. We have used the Office for National Statistics property sales data to create five local authority bands. Local authorities will typically be offered between £60,000 and £90,000 respectively, a small number of very large authorities will be offered a higher amount. These payment amounts are non-negotiable.</p>
          <p>Local authorities will receive two separate payments, when they achieve two key delivery milestones. The first payment will be issued when they sign their Delivery Plan and formally enter service migration. After the service goes live, they will receive the second final payment.</p>
          <p>For LAs that miss their second milestone we will apply a tapered system of weekly deductions which will determine the amount the LA will receive if they meet a revised serve notice date. The LA will have 2.5% of the milestone 2 payment deducted for each week past the original deadline. If cause of the delay lies with HM Land Registry, payment will be made as normal.</p>
          <p>Payments are conditional on local authorities meeting the delivery milestones, by the dates agreed with HM Land Registry.</p>
